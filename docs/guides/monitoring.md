# Monitoring
Raccoon provides monitoring for server connection, Kafka publisher, resource usage, and event delivery. Reference for available metrics is available [here](../reference/metrics.md). The metrics are reported using [Statsd](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/statsd/) protocol.
## How To Setup
First, you need to configure the metric collector that support Statsd. You can use [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/getting-started-with-sending-statsd-metrics-to-telegraf-influxdb/) or [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/?tab=hostagent) for example. You will have port which the metric collector listen. After you have the collector with port configured, you need to set [METRIC_STATSD_ADDRESS](../reference/configuration.md) to match the metric collector port. What left is to visualize the metrics once you collect the data. For example, you can use [Chronograf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/chronograf/) or [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/) with Telegraf.
